vKeyboard is an on-screen keyboard optimized for small screens written
in Python2.7 using the Tkinter framework.

It supplies a four line, three layer (a-z, A-Z and 0-9 including popular
symbols) keyboard and supports multiple single-line entry widgets. 

I needed it for a project and couldn't find one, so I built it myself - 
based upon tkinter-keyboard by petemojeiko, see [2]. I'm satisfied with this
version, so updates are unlikely.
